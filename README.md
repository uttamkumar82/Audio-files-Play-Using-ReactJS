Hii,
This is my React app where-
(a) a user can upload audio files(mp3),
(b) Store the audio file
(c) Play  the audio file and user can able to continue next file also in the playlist after/before completion of song.
(d) There is no any API used like Spotify, jiosavan etc. it means users have to store songs and make a playlist first.
